# Computer-Assignment. 
# Project Goal: 
For this holiday we will be working on a project idea will be submitting for graduation purposes. For Compassion Kenya will be finishing our learning in "February " and for KilifiGoa will be finishing in March. 
So will  go through the 5 stages of project management  if you feel this tough you can use the same process on a portfolio project. 

# Methodology: Use the five stages of project management to guide your work.

Take a pen and a book then write down the stages...and use it as a guide when you finish stage one tick it on your book.


## Stages:

### Initiation:
Here you will do brain storming you will ask yourself the following questions.
* 1. What am I good at? (Mention at least five things..include your profession or school work)
I am good at:
    i) Teaching
    ii) mentorship programmes in educational matters
    iii) I'm interested in enteprenuership.

* 2. What projects can I do with my strengths? (Try and align projects with your answer from question 1.)
 I can do a projects related to education, after a thorough though and deliberation with colleagues, i decided we collaborate in doing a learning management system that will aid the teaching and learning in the schools as instutions.   

* 3. You can also ask what challenge am i facing at school and also at home or my village or church. (Write any that comes to mind)
As i teach the students at the Junior secondary school level, I'm faced by numerous challenges one being the learners not easily having access to the 
necessary information needed by their teachers. 
*for instance, when giving assignments to do at home,they go about the internet and extract information not at their level.

* 4. Among the challenges what solution can I have? ( Create it as a project idea.)
I can come up with an LMS that will help not only the learners but also the teachers to deliver the content and where the learners can get the relevant conten as required by their tutors.

* 5. Ask yourself what your goals are.
Among the many goals, I would like to see learners have a flawless learning process and the teachers organise their preferred content to their learners so as to suit their needs. The LMS will provide a platform not only for learning but some interactive sessions for some educational games and also an easy way of tacking the learners performance.
*This will of course require some knowledge in Database as a module which I'm pursuing cocurrently.

* 6. What goals are more achievable?
I can design a great LMS which has numerous features.
This LMS can be integrated in the teaching-learning process to ease the burden of irrelevant content by the learners.

## Planning: 
Here try and think about how your project will look like. Ask the following Questions?

* 1. Will the users sign in and log in?
There will be sign in for the learners, teachers and the school adminstrators.
This will include the learners admission numbers, school name, school code, current grade and age for the learners.
The teachers will have their TSC numbers, National ID, school code and porfolio of the teacher whether they are classteachers.
For the school admins, they will be the ones controlling the LMS per school level coordinated by the teachers mandeted to do so.

* 2. Will we have a home page?
The home page will contain the log in/ sign in details.

* 3. Will we have a contact page?
The contact page will be to reach us the developers of the programme. We shall be using this to get feedback from our users. This will help us improve on our programme for efficiency and effectiveness.

* 4. What other features will it have?
It will contain the subjects to be taught depending on the level of the learners.
This section will contain the content to be learnt by the learners, the teachers will have the mandate to upload and update whichever content will deem fit by them.

** I advice you to draw on a piece of paper a roadmap of what you expect and create a clear plan with dates and timelines.

## Execution: Communicate
Implement the plan, manage tasks, monitor progress, and  address any challenges.
Here you come to the instructors and ask for help if you encounter any bugs or difficulties.

### Monitoring and Control: 
Track progress against the plan, adapt to any changes and ensure the project stays on track.

### Closure:
Here you submit your project on the project submission form that will be provided on 5th January 2023 ...You will submit your GitHub link a video on YouTube on how your project works and if you worked in a group your group members' names.

Additional Notes:

Consider specifying the nature of the project (e.g., research, community service, design, etc.) for better understanding.
If using the same project for different programs, clearly differentiate the specific deliverables and completion dates for each.
